# React App README

This is a README file for Coding Pigeons's react app project, TrainTogether. The app is a web-based application that allows users to search for nearby fitness corners and customise an exercise plan based on its location and facilities. Users can also create an account and log in to the app to interact with various features and functionalities. The app is built using React, a JavaScript library for creating user interfaces.

## Installation and Usage

To install and run the app, you will need to have Node.js and npm installed on your computer. Node.js is a runtime environment that allows you to run JavaScript code outside of a browser. npm is a package manager that lets you install and manage dependencies for your project.

To install Node.js and npm, you can follow the instructions on their official website: https://nodejs.org/en/

Once you have Node.js and npm installed, you need to install the node modules that are required for the app. These are the libraries and packages that provide various functionalities and features for the app.

To install the node modules, you need to navigate to the project folder in your terminal and run the following command:

```bash
npm install
```

This will install all the dependencies listed in the package.json file.

## Running the App
To run the app, you need to use the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm start
```

This will start a local server and open the app in your default browser. You can also access the app by visiting http://localhost:3000 in your browser.

You can now explore and use the app as you wish. Enjoy!
